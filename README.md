## Testing the Integration:

1. **Start Development Server**

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

2. **Access in Browser**

```
http://localhost:8000/clients/1/
```

3. **Expected Behavior**

- Shows loading spinner initially
- Gradually populates client details
- Loads policies and claims tables
- Interactive buttons with hover states

**Next Steps Recommendation:**
Should we implement:

1. Search functionality with API endpoints
2. Policy detail modal implementation
3. Authentication flow integration
4. Form handling for creating new clients/policies?
